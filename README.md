# Data Analysis with Python
This repo contains my data analysis projects in Python Jupyter Notebook. I have used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other python libraries. In each project, I have deducted insights from the data and provided data-driven decisions.
- Project 1: I analyzed google playstore apps and recommended a category for a new startup to launch their app.
- Project 2: I recommended the timeline for which the posts will get maximum response.
- Project 3: I provided insights about different car models and recommended car models that will have high resale price based on used car listings EBAY data.
- Project 4: I analyzed US Jobs survey and delivered insights about male dominated and female dominated majors in US univeristies. I also concluded which major have highest paid employees both for male and Female.
